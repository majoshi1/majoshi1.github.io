2) Major components of Object Orientation
(PIE: polymorphism, inheritance and encapsulation)
Encapsulation: hides the properties and methods, preventing unauthorized access. 
Java provides keywords like private and protected.
Abstraction: defines the properties and methods without implementation. Java has interfaces.

Inheritance: achieves reusability. And can be static or dynamic.
Static provides "is a" relationship. Java provides "extends" and "implements" keywords.
Dynamic provides "has a" relationship.
Two types in dynamic - Composition and Aggregation.
Composition - Holding the reference of the other class within some other class is known as composition.
Aggregation - It is a special type of composition. 
If you expose all the methods of a composite class and 
route the method call to the composite method through its reference, then it is called aggregation.
Static has tight coupling, so dynamic is preferred.

Polymorphism: provides single interface to call methods of derived objects. 
Add new derived classes without breaking the calling code.
Overloading with different method signatures.
Over-riding with parent-child relation.

-----------------------------------------------
Composition (has a), Aggregation (has a - weak)
Composition & Aggregation: implementations can be replaced at run-time
Library-Student is aggregation.
Library-Book is composition.
-----------------------------------------------

3) Difference between Abstract Class and Interface
Abstract class methods can have implementation. Interface methods don't.
Abstract classes are mainly used in frameworks.

4) Explain interface for Object Orientation
Interface provides abstraction.
It has properties and methods without implementation.
Gives ability to decompose complex systems into smaller components.

Major components of Object Orientation

Inheritance: tight coupling
Composition: implementations can be replaced at run-time
Library-Student is aggregation.
Library-Book is composition.
Polymorphism: Single interface to call methods of derived objects. 
Add new classes of derived objects without breaking the calling code.

Interface defines class skeleton.
