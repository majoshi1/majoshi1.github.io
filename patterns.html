9) Can you name some design patters you have used in your projects. Do you know what command is and have you used it.
Singleton, Factory, Decorator, Mediator, and MVC.

Singleton: Private constructor, private static variable to store the instance, and static getter function to get the same instance.
Command is a behavioural design pattern in which class stores information about a method.
Strategy = algorithm based classes
Template pattern : Defer some steps to subclass.
When you have a sequence of steps to be processed within a method and you want to defer some of the steps to its subclass.
Java Framework:
	java.lang.Runtime: Singleton
	java.lang.String: Flyweight (uses pool of constants)
	JDBC framework: Facade
	IO classes: Decorator (Reader/Writer, XXXInputStream/XXXOutputStream)
	RMI Framework: Proxy
	DriverManager: Chain of R.

Creational
• Singleton Pattern is a pattern that ensures there is one and only one
instance of an object, and that it is possible to obtain global access to that
one instance.
• Factory Pattern is used to choose and return an instance of a class
from a number of similar classes based on data you provide to the
factory.
• Abstract Factory Pattern is used to return one of several groups of
classes. In some cases it actually returns a Factory for that group of
classes.
• Builder Pattern assembles a number of objects to make a new
object, based on the data with which it is presented. Frequently, the
choice of which way the objects are assembled is achieved using a
Factory.
• Prototype Pattern copies or clones an existing class rather than
creating a new instance when creating new instances is more expensive.

Behavioral Patterns
• Observer pattern is a pub-sub model. Subject (publisher) maintains a list of observers (subscribers).
• Mediator handles communication between classes (colleagues).
• Façade pattern groups a complex object hierarchy and
provides a new, simpler interface to access those data.
• Flyweight pattern provides a way to limit the proliferation of
small, similar class instances by moving some of the class data outside
the class and passing it in during various execution methods.
• Proxy pattern provides a simple place-holder class for a more
complex class which is expensive to instantiate.
• Adapter pattern is used to change the interface of one class to that of
another one.
• Bridge pattern is intended to keep the interface to your client program
constant while allowing you to change the actual kind of class you
display or use. You can then change the interface and the underlying class
separately.
• Composite pattern, a collection of objects, any one of which may be
either itself a Composite, or just a primitive object.
• Decorator pattern, a class that surrounds a given class, adds new
capabilities to it, and passes all the unchanged methods to the underlying
class.

Visitor = Method overloading
Builder = Selective Factory
Strategy = algorithm based classes
Template pattern : Defer some steps to subclass.
When you have a sequence of steps to be processed within a method and you want to defer
some of the steps to its subclass then you can use a template method pattern.
