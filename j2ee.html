<PRE>
Deployment descriptors: XML configs for web application (jar, war). Also, web.xml
Servlet: init, service, destroy
init: create thread-safe resources like JDBC datasources
EJB method calls likes:
init: jndi lookup, home-interface lookup
service / doGet/ doPost: create bean from home interface

Pass VO instead of session between servlet and jsp

Web app: Document root (jsp) & WEB-INF (classes,libs etc)

GET vs POST: POST has data in body, while GET has in URL.

Thread-safe servlet: In multi-threaded environment, synchronize as needed.

Servlet with long DB query: Client polling, JMS with MDB (Message Driven Bean).

Forward vs redirect: Forward happens in server with relative path.
Redirect comes to browser with absolute path.

Servlet Filters: Intercepts HTTP requests in web application. 
I used it to apply gzip compression, to reduce network throughput.
Other use can be usage stats.

JSP: Dynamic compile, extends HTTPServlet.
JSP Scopes: Page, Request, Session, Application
Static vs Dynamic include: @ include and jsp:include.
JVM has 64KB limit on method size. So, static should be small.
Otherwise split or use dynamic.

Implicit JSP Objects: request, response, pageContext, session, application, out, config, page, exception.

JSP instance vs local variables: Instance (<%! int a %>) variables are not thread-safe.

Local (<% int a %>) variables are thread-safe.

JSP tags (JSTL): Core (c), Formatting (fmt), XML (x), Database (sql).

JNDI: Provides interface to LDAP.

2-phase commit: Approach for commiting across two databases.
Phase 1: Prepare or Request phase decides whether to commit or rollback.
Phase 2: Commits

J2EE Best practises:
Pooling & Caching: Pool threads, db connections, objects. 
Cache data. Idle timeout of unused session beans.
Network:
Session Facade: Single request from client.
Value Object: Single object avoiding multiple client calls.
Service Locator: Caches JNDI lookup results.
Serialization: Use transient for avoiding cost of serialization.
Prepared Statements for efficient and batch updates.
Set auto-commit off
