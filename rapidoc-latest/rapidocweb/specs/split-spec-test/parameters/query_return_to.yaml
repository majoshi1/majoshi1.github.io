description: |
  Return to this URI following the login process. An optional `status`
  query string parameter will be added to this URL if there is a
  problem during login (`status=failed_login`) or logout has been called (`status=logout`).

  Please note, that the URI has to be fully qualified and the hostname has to be one
  of our supported origins as for the CORS calls. Otherwise the default URIs will be used
  which just show a simple "ok" text.
