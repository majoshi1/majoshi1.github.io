    Provide the profile of the user. In case the pilot is online and undocked, `system` provides
    their current location.

    The online status gets updated every 60 seconds, while location gets updated every 5 seconds.

    If the frontend wants to work with the pilots location, it should fetch this endpoint every 5 seconds,
    otherwise, for [`/v2/private/users/online`](#get-/v2/private/users/online) to work properly,
    it should fetch it every 60 seconds.
