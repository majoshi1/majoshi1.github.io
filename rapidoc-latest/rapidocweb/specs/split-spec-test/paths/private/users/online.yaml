  summary: Users Online Status
  description: |
    Show the status of all pilots online at the moment, which means they have been
    online while in Thera or Turnur during the last 15 minutes.

    This is supposed to provide an indicator for pilots so they know who's potentially working
    on signatures at the same time.
