  summary: Switch Signature Type
  description: |
    Switch the type of the signature (`signature_type`) and change the "state" of the signature.

    The behaviour is identical to [Bulk Add Signatures](#post-/v2/private/signatures) as long as
    the type is "unknown", except that it can change the signature type of a single signature later on.

    If the current type is "wormhole", all data except create data, update data and the comment
    get purged.

    When the signature type is set to "wormhole", the signature can be modified via
    [Patch Signature](#patch-/v2/private/signatures/-signature-id-) later on.
