  summary: Bulk Add Signatures
  x-badges:

  description: |
    This endpoint facilitates the bulk addition and modification of signatures based on data of the in-game
    Probe Scan Window.

    1. **Skipping Existing Signatures with Defined Types**:
      - If a signature already exists in the system and has a `signature_type` other than "unknown", the signature
      will not be processed or altered.

    2. **Updating 'Unknown' Signatures**:
      - If the system already has a signature with a `signature_type` of "unknown", and a new entry for the same
      signature is provided with a defined `signature_type`, the signature in the system will be updated to the
      new type.

    3. **Creating Nonexistent Signatures**:
      - For any signatures provided in the request that do not already exist in the system, they will be newly
      created and added.

    4. **Transactional Safety and Error Handling**:
      - This endpoint is designed with an atomic transactional approach. If any part of the bulk operation encounters
      an error, no changes will be committed. The entire operation will be reverted and an error message will be
      returned.
