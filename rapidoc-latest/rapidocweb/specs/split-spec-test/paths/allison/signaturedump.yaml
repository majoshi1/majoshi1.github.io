  summary: Signature Dump
  description: |
    This endpoint is used for development and debugging only.

    It allows to list all signatures which were available at a certain time in the past and
    returns them as ready to use database statements to import them into the development
    system.

    It also allows to modify the timestamps of the signatures so the system now shows the
    exact same data as at that time in the past.
