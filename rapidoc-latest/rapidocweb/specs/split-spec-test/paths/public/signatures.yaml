        Optional parameter which generates a randomly created result for testing.
        -1 means the number of returned elements is also random, otherwise it specifies the number of
        signatures to create.

  summary: List Public Signatures
  description: |
    List all public resources in the `signatures` collection. A `signature`
    is considered "public" if it has been fully scanned and has not expired
    or been deleted.

    **NOTES**:
    - The EOL status of a signature can be determined by its `expires_at` property. If this drops
      below 4 hours, the wormhole is getting close to its end of life.
    - To locate the entrance and exit of the wormhole, `wh_exits_outward` can be used. When set to `true`,
      the wormhole type is on the hub's side (Thera or Turnur) and K162 can be found on the outside.

            The last time one of our scouts interacted with our private Hub Scan Tool, which is the backend data input
            system used to keep our wormhole signature information up to date.
