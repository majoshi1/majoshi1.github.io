  summary: Routes to high-sec
  description: |
    Calculate up to five routes to the closest high-sec systems from the provided system.
    The routing algorithm removes all routes which have overlapping routes, e.g. if
    e.g. in route A->B->C systems B and C would be high-sec systems, A->B would be returned,
    while A->B->C would be omitted.
