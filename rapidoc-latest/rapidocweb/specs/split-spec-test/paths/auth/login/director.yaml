  description: |
    Initiate the EVE-SSO login process and create a server-side session for
    the user.

    This login is used specifically for the Alliance directors, so the API gets access to
    a refresh token, which can be stored in the database to access ESI endpoints which
    require specific permissions, such as `/corporations/{corporation_id}/members/` and
    `/characters/{character_id}/wallet/journal/`.

    This endpoint has to be called directly and does not support cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
